1
00:00:06,766 --> 00:00:10,850
Gothic was one of the first, immersive open world RPGs.

2
00:00:10,983 --> 00:00:14,250
Our job was really to find out, what element should stay

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,483
exactly as they are, what element should be expanded.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,900
Throughout the whole production we found ourselves in struggle between old and new.

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,000
Making of Gothic remake

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,433
Chapter II. Old vs. new

7
00:00:53,433 --> 00:00:55,566
Our approach for the story was like, hey

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,600
the original story is actually good, but

9
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:00,483
it has plot holes,

10
00:01:00,583 --> 00:01:02,900
it has things that are unlogical

11
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,350
and it has things that are contradicting each other.

12
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,983
So our initial think was like,

13
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:10,050
“Okay we have to set out and fix these three points.”

14
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,783
That was one of my first tasks,

15
00:01:12,783 --> 00:01:17,650
get everything that we can extract from the old games over to like Unreal,

16
00:01:17,683 --> 00:01:20,083
or other tools for our designers to take a look at.

17
00:01:20,183 --> 00:01:23,183
So they can understand how the game worked,

18
00:01:23,183 --> 00:01:24,450
like go through all the conversations,

19
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:31,233
like a tree size structure um with all the requirements, all the dependencies

20
00:01:31,233 --> 00:01:34,233
between topics, conditions and so on.

21
00:01:35,016 --> 00:01:38,200
Together with the writing team we came up with with solutions

22
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,733
and sometimes we had heated discussions about this because

23
00:01:40,783 --> 00:01:42,133
it's getting very emotional.

24
00:01:42,383 --> 00:01:46,833
We we didn't choose the easiest and most straightforward solution,

25
00:01:46,833 --> 00:01:51,533
but we chose a solution that fits very well in the context of the game.

26
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:54,833
Now we have Alkimia Narrative tool, as it's called.

27
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:02,700
The tool that can handle the complexity of the original game's dialogues. The tool that can display that, handle that and you can work with it.

28
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,550
And this was the base for our designers to iterate on the original dialogues,

29
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,666
daily routines AI states, the combat AI is implemented in there.

30
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:17,766
All the character configuration, what interactions they can do,

31
00:02:17,766 --> 00:02:20,016
what animations they should play.

32
00:02:20,016 --> 00:02:25,350
It’s all in this scripting language and you can go there and modify it as you like.

33
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:28,633
We even had at one point, a sort of running

34
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,250
version of the original game in Unreal.

35
00:02:31,266 --> 00:02:34,266
The biggest challenge from a design perspective is

36
00:02:34,266 --> 00:02:38,500
the making the world feel alive and hold this work with all the systems

37
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:41,900
because in the end, we are creating a living world with a lot of characters,

38
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:44,933
but we are not just configuring the daily routines or their

39
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,500
homes or the the kind of things.

40
00:02:46,516 --> 00:02:50,300
This is a systemic game, so they react to the player actions,

41
00:02:50,383 --> 00:02:53,383
to the all the system, like they are witness of your crimes,

42
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:56,500
how you enter trespassing a forbidden area,

43
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,666
how you launch an object and they interact with that.

44
00:03:00,016 --> 00:03:03,016
Modernizing these systems with all these the world building

45
00:03:03,133 --> 00:03:05,183
and world setting and make everything works together

46
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:09,050
is a really, really challenging thing for us.

47
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:14,200
From a technical point of view, if you have an open world and you can go everywhere,

48
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:18,716
you need to consider that the world needs to live on while the player is not there.

49
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:22,633
We actually have for the full world the daily routines,

50
00:03:22,633 --> 00:03:26,016
the living world simulation is always going.

51
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:30,450
and when you come close to an to an NPC so they spawn,

52
00:03:30,616 --> 00:03:33,616
they will be spawned where they would be if you were just standing there waiting.

53
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,583
For example we have this, we have the templars

54
00:03:37,783 --> 00:03:40,333
walking from the Sect camp to the Old mine

55
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:43,616
and in the original game you could never meet them in between the camps.

56
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:47,800
Now you can stand somewhere wait for the full day,

57
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,633
yeah they will arrive at some point.

58
00:03:49,633 --> 00:03:52,050
Then there was the part where we kind of like set out,

59
00:03:52,116 --> 00:03:54,283
well, the German version is iconic

60
00:03:54,283 --> 00:03:57,900
and so is probably the Polish version and the Russian version,

61
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:00,900
but like the English version is actually not iconic.

62
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:04,033
Throughout this series it kind of changed style, so that's one thing.

63
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:09,933
It didn't manage to translate this rough language to the entire like story.

64
00:04:10,266 --> 00:04:13,433
So we set out to do a rework of the English texts

65
00:04:13,816 --> 00:04:18,600
and that was our starting point and why that we discovered even more of these plot holes

66
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:21,666
and things that we need to improve and make better.

67
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,750
Then there are aspects where we added things, that were just

68
00:04:24,916 --> 00:04:31,450
not touched on enough or in later chapters there's too much shortcuts

69
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,250
about it or there are places in the world that are not used.

70
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:38,533
The most interesting part of the Gothic Remake would be

71
00:04:38,533 --> 00:04:41,550
the cut content from the original game.

72
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,350
The places that were pretty empty in the original game

73
00:04:45,466 --> 00:04:48,133
and in Gothic Remake we create them

74
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:52,866
and put here and there new things that would enhance the experience.

75
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:57,033
We try to make a little bit more interesting the dungeons

76
00:04:57,033 --> 00:05:01,050
and also the way the player can get into the castle.

77
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:05,550
It’s like very hidden and you can guess that there is

78
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,550
something different there, if you go to the to the Gomez cellar.

79
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:15,116
One aspect about the story that I can tease here, that we kind of added

80
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:18,850
and this is like the way how you interact with the Orc culture.

81
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:22,733
Which I feel like was in the original very base level, I mean you had this interaction

82
00:05:23,016 --> 00:05:25,200
with Ur-Shak and Tarrok.

83
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:29,716
It was to a level where it was like “Yeah, okay it served a single purpose”

84
00:05:29,716 --> 00:05:32,483
and then it's like you just kill them off.

85
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:35,483
But I mean the whole thing in the whole Gothic lore,

86
00:05:35,483 --> 00:05:40,416
the whole theme with the orcs is actually the reason why everything is happening.

87
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,533
It's the reason for why the colony exists.

88
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:49,050
It's the reason for why the barrier exists because without the ore mining,

89
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,766
which is needed for the war you would not have the need to create a barrier.

90
00:05:52,783 --> 00:05:55,783
We felt like we need to give this more space.

91
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:10,333
As I'm mostly engaged with all the content related to economy,

92
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,383
what I try to do is mine the whole game.

93
00:06:13,383 --> 00:06:15,233
I have a model of the the original game.

94
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,216
Then I try to see patterns.

95
00:06:17,283 --> 00:06:20,633
Patterns that talks to me about how, what was the original intent,

96
00:06:20,633 --> 00:06:23,633
with how the economy evolved, how the progression evolved.

97
00:06:23,966 --> 00:06:26,966
And then I tried to see where those patterns break

98
00:06:26,983 --> 00:06:31,683
because for example in the original Gothic the economical progression,

99
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,050
was quite broken for the last chapters.

100
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:35,566
You cannot generate value from nothing.

101
00:06:35,716 --> 00:06:38,316
The player should not be the central bank of the economy.

102
00:06:38,533 --> 00:06:42,200
And that also connects with the trading systems because

103
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:44,600
the traders in the original game were quite passive.

104
00:06:44,766 --> 00:06:48,416
They only regenerated their inventory and the ore between chapters.

105
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,150
But we have a passive system that do some garbage collecting,

106
00:06:52,150 --> 00:06:55,150
so some items are expansed from the economy.

107
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,250
Those items are managed as if they were being traded between the traders,

108
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:04,683
So those items are converted into ore so there's always liquidity in the market.

109
00:07:04,683 --> 00:07:08,966
There's not an overabundance of materials, so we always have control

110
00:07:09,116 --> 00:07:10,533
of how much you can craft.

111
00:07:10,716 --> 00:07:13,416
At some point the economy will break, I mean it's a closed economy.

112
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:17,616
It's it's bound to break because the only active agent is the is the character.

113
00:07:17,716 --> 00:07:22,250
But if we can delay that to the sixth chapter that would be the best case scenario.

114
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:25,266
The the exploration is a key part of the game.

115
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:30,166
This is a hard technical thing that we've been looking into,

116
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,783
through the whole development, such as giving the players this feeling

117
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:37,316
of being lost. Once it gets dark you're just lost.

118
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,450
I mean we have a lot of places that even if it's day,

119
00:07:42,716 --> 00:07:45,900
you just get lost, so at night everything is super dark,

120
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,316
but you still can manage your way through.

121
00:07:48,316 --> 00:07:52,033
You can have a lot of spells or even

122
00:07:52,033 --> 00:07:55,033
your own torch that would help you go

123
00:07:55,166 --> 00:07:59,300
through all these places, but definitely if you don't have a good sense of orientation

124
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,200
you gonna get lost.

125
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,750
Each one has its own environment and personality

126
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,783
because all the characters

127
00:08:06,783 --> 00:08:09,366
in each camp are unique in one way or another.

128
00:08:09,366 --> 00:08:12,533
But in the end, when you keep on walking around the world you can see

129
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,483
that all the camps are somehow connected,

130
00:08:14,483 --> 00:08:17,533
characters move from one place to another

131
00:08:17,716 --> 00:08:22,500
and the stories are interrelated among them.

132
00:08:22,616 --> 00:08:30,233
The main idea we have regarding hoarding is to force the player to consume items.

133
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:35,716
Be it because the combat is difficult, be it because there is some dynamics

134
00:08:35,733 --> 00:08:38,733
that require the use of those items evidently.

135
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:44,183
There is a problem with all open world RPGs, that it tends to be an

136
00:08:44,183 --> 00:08:47,383
overabundance of items because you don't know where the player is going to be,

137
00:08:47,466 --> 00:08:51,733
where the player is going to look at and you must guarantee a minimum viable

138
00:08:51,766 --> 00:08:55,833
amount of utility for the player to overcome the challenges.

139
00:08:56,233 --> 00:09:05,683
So if you have a very serious player that loots everything and it's a hoarder by nature,

140
00:09:05,883 --> 00:09:10,083
we won't be able to combat that, but at least uh the design

141
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:18,266
will try to put the player in situations that force them to use the items they have.

142
00:09:24,883 --> 00:09:27,016
With RPGs you tend to spend a lot of time.

143
00:09:27,016 --> 00:09:30,983
In a lot of games you actually get tired of the music at some point,

144
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:37,183
but in Gothic you never get tired, which is also related to the system that they used back in the day.

145
00:09:37,450 --> 00:09:40,750
There wasn't kind of like a master track, that they would just play back.

146
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:45,333
It would kind of like layers that depending on what happens in the game world,

147
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:49,983
it would play different cues, so it kind of like always felt different.

148
00:09:50,283 --> 00:09:55,766
So my main priority when making music is - I want to be
a messenger of emotions.

149
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,733
I want to understand, as the composer I want to understand

150
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,683
the emotional message that is in every single scene in the game.

151
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:08,133
And I want to be able to kind of push the emotional impact on the player.

152
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:13,083
It adds a certain depth to the game because you can actually feel what's going on and it

153
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:17,616
doesn't just work as like background music, but also as its own aspect to the

154
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,916
emotional landscapes.

155
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:21,533
You can imagine it as painting pictures.

156
00:10:21,566 --> 00:10:24,016
So I imagine a situation for example,

157
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:27,383
where there's a sense of determination and adventure.

158
00:10:27,783 --> 00:10:31,366
Then I try to come up with an image that represents that.

159
00:10:31,683 --> 00:10:36,150
Sometimes I do abstract drawings, sometimes I pick something from from the internet

160
00:10:36,516 --> 00:10:39,516
and then I look at all those individual visual elements

161
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,666
and try to come up with music ideas for those.

162
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,950
So for example if I have a strong, key image

163
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,733
in the center of my abstract painting for example,

164
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:55,766
I try to get an idea of what instrument could represent that specific part of the picture.

165
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:59,233
And then I just play around with it,

166
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:03,400
I experiment with different melodic ideas, with different harmonies and through

167
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:07,783
lots of iteration and tinkering around in my software I come to the final result.

168
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:13,616
I'm most excited actually to get the new or the extended abilities

169
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:17,316
in the hands of the players, So we've spent a lot of time

170
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,350
analyzing like, what sort of abilities actually don't fulfill the true vision

171
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:25,016
of what it could make sense in the world of Gothic.

172
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:29,083
We’ve teased some of it a little bit in the gameplay reveal

173
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:33,483
with the climbing, will add another dimension and it's similar

174
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:36,533
actually to the climbing in Zelda, but it's obviously kind of like

175
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:39,200
limited to certain areas of the game.

176
00:11:39,716 --> 00:11:41,933
And then another thing like we’ve teased, like

177
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:47,683
first of all we try to kind of like make some interesting underwater path and locations.

178
00:11:47,683 --> 00:11:54,050
So there's a lot to explore there, but also diving is a proper like skill that you need to learn

179
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:55,300
and get better on.

180
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:59,150
You can also like interact with objects underwater, which is pretty cool,

181
00:11:59,266 --> 00:12:02,266
so you can pick up loot, you can interact with stuff.

182
00:12:02,466 --> 00:12:07,316
So that's that's all stuff that I feel like, I'm proud that we did it,

183
00:12:07,516 --> 00:12:09,883
like that we don't just copy the original.

184
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,916
Most of the materials will be used for different crafting stations,

185
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:17,083
so alchemy, cooking, whatever.

186
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:20,416
The idea is that those recipes will evolve with the player,

187
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:24,683
so if the player invests points in that those recipes will become useful.

188
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:29,766
Across the gameplay and also there is an important thing that even

189
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:32,933
if you don't have immediate utility for that

190
00:12:33,216 --> 00:12:40,550
recipe at that moment, the act of crafting has an inherent value in

191
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:43,550
reducing the abundance of materials in your inventory

192
00:12:43,816 --> 00:12:46,566
and gaining a bit of ore from the process.

193
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,866
So you spend time in and you gain a lot of utility in ore.

194
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,150
And there's things I'm sure there are things that are controversial,

195
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:59,650
that people are like "Well you’re contradicting what the original set out".

196
00:13:00,066 --> 00:13:04,900
We tried to limit these things and we wanted to be extra sure that like,

197
00:13:04,983 --> 00:13:07,116
our solution is actually better.

198
00:13:07,266 --> 00:13:08,750
We cannot please everybody.

199
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,433
We hope that players look at it give it a try to understand our motivation

200
00:13:13,766 --> 00:13:18,650
And I'm happy to talk through about this after the game is out

201
00:13:18,683 --> 00:13:21,683
and give detailed reason for why we did the way we did.

202
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:24,816
Obviously I don't want to spoil things.

203
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:29,916
Our approach of coping with this struggle between old and new was

204
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:35,783
being practical and finding a certain baseline, that is always within the

205
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:38,883
Gothic vision and especially close to the original.

206
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,000
We can't wait to hear what you think about this.

207
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:44,616
I mean for us we are not done with it.

208
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:47,616
I mean, like getting started.

209
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,140
(Spanish.) Good morning, Gothic fans!

210
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,070
It's not (yet) time to go hunt some boar

211
00:14:02,070 --> 00:14:04,110
Kai when finalizing the sound for this video "Just a little second more!"

212
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,390
We are just here to crawl in "Gomez" ass

213
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,510
After this video I need to buy another SSD, again!

214
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,190
Gomez knows nothing... yet

215
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:10,000
May the sleeper awaken!

216
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Wishlist now!
