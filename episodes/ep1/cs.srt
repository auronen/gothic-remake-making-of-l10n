1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
(todo).

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,400
Originální Gothic

3
00:00:10,633 --> 00:00:14,566
byl tak populární a unkatní na svou dobu, že si myslím,

4
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:17,466
že si zaslouží pořádný remake.

5
00:00:38,174 --> 00:00:43,225
(todo).

6
00:00:46,466 --> 00:00:48,900
(todo).

7
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,000
Náš přístup byl především

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,550
respektovat a přijmout vizi původní hry.

9
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:58,950
Studovali jsme původní vizi, snažili jsme se pochopit všechno,

10
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,116
co se snažili říct, co se snažili hrou vyjádřit.

11
00:01:01,116 --> 00:01:04,666
A potom jsme si řekli, okay - tohle je Remake.

12
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,066
To je ta první věc, kterou by fanoušci měli vědět.

13
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,450
nesnažíme se objevovat dávno objevené, nebo dělat se sérií Gothic

14
00:01:10,616 --> 00:01:11,933
něco šíleného.

15
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:13,733
Je to remake - přijímáme

16
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:17,466
a ctíme původní vizi hry a snažíme se k tomuto úkolu přistopovat 

17
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:19,416
s nejvyšším respektem.

18
00:01:19,483 --> 00:01:22,916
Po tolika letech a vlastně po docela krátce po

19
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:26,300
vydání Gothicu 1, pokaždé když jsem si zpětně poslechl svou hudbu,

20
00:01:26,316 --> 00:01:27,316
kterou jsem tehdy složil,

21
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,783
jsem vždy našel místa, která bych rád vylepšil.

22
00:01:32,183 --> 00:01:35,016
Kdybych měl více času, hudbu bych zahodil 

23
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,983
a nahradil ji jinými nápad,

24
00:01:37,616 --> 00:01:40,500
abych ukojil konstantní nutkání

25
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,483
dělat všechno lépe.

26
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,600
Teď jsem dostal druhou šanci, vrátit se ke své hudbě,

27
00:01:46,716 --> 00:01:49,616
kterou jsem tenkrát napsal a vytvořit novou verzi,

28
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:52,466
která bude nadčasová.

29
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:56,083
Už je to víc než 20 let, co vyšel první Gothic,

30
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,200
a je složité přijít na to,

31
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,500
jak přenést něco s takovou historií,

32
00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:06,183
do moderní doby, se současnými technologiemi

33
00:02:06,183 --> 00:02:10,566
a jak zůstat věrní originálnímu

34
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,166
požitku z hraní hry,

35
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,150
která byla dost inovativní, nová

36
00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:20,733
pro celý herní trh a ca přinesla ostatním RPG.

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,633
Ponořil jsem se do světa Gothicu

38
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:27,200
díky Kaii Rosenkranzovi a jeho díle.

39
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:34,133
A já bych chtěl poděkaovat překladatelskému týmu Snowball,

40
00:02:34,283 --> 00:02:36,316
protože ti odvedli pořádný kus práce.

41
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:41,050
Dabing a překlad mi hodně pomohli ponořit se do světa Gtohicu.

42
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,566
Myslím, že Gothic 1 byla hra, která dovolila

43
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,600
hráči jít kamkoliv a kdykoliv.

44
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,916
Díky tomu má hráč

45
00:02:52,183 --> 00:02:54,600
možnost dělat vlastní rozhodnutí.

46
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,016
Bylo to, já nevím, 15 let?

47
00:02:57,216 --> 00:02:59,400
Přes 10 let. Nic se s Gothicem nedělo.

48
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,316
A to je smutné, je to série a hra

49
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,500
na které lidem hluboce záleží, mají k ní citový vztah,

50
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,983
a já jsem z toho také smutný

51
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:14,016
že jsem si nemohl zahrát další hru Gothic behěm těch let.

52
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:17,316
Bojujeme se vzpomínkami.

53
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:20,733
Snažíme se jen podtrhnout původni vizi autorů.

54
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,150
Když jsem byl mladý, hrál jsem hry v němčině.

55
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,400
Byla to jedna z mála her

56
00:03:25,883 --> 00:03:31,200
která měla skutečné postavy a autentičnost

57
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,000
německé kultury.

58
00:03:34,216 --> 00:03:37,100
Dialogy byly napsané tak,

59
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:42,916
jak bychom se spolu bavili ty a já, kdybychom byli, nevím, no.. popíjeli pivo a jen si povídali. Ne?

60
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,666
A to je něco, co dřív nikdo ve hře předtím neudělal,

61
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,766
bylo to tak přirozené a realistické

62
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,183
bez toho, aby to byla simlace nebo něco takového.

63
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,966
Vždycky mě to fascinovalo.

64
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,450
protože postavy si ve hře nadávali

65
00:04:02,683 --> 00:04:06,666
a reagovali na sebe, někdy i dost hrubě,

66
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:10,250
a to se mi moc líbilo.

67
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:14,766
Myslím si, že ta hra měla v sobě něco speciálního už od začátku,

68
00:04:14,766 --> 00:04:18,583
od chvíle, co začnete hrát, vás hra pohltí,

69
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,300
vtáhne vás svou

70
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,800
temnou

71
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:25,450
a drsnou aurou, kteorá na vás rychle dýchne.

72
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:31,533
Ten pocit, že jste součástí světa

73
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:35,183
je už v hudbě, v prostředí, všude.

74
00:04:36,983 --> 00:04:40,266
Gothic jsem měl rád, kvůli jeho prostředí a světu.

75
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:43,400
What really caught my attention was that it was a game

76
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,033
I wasn’t used to playing at the time.

77
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:48,950
A game that doesn’t guide you, doesn’t tell you where to go

78
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,950
or what to do.

79
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,616
You have to pay attention to what the characters say,

80
00:04:52,616 --> 00:04:54,433
buy the map, and stay very alert.

81
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:55,433
That’s truly

82
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:57,166
a very immersive experience,

83
00:04:57,466 --> 00:05:01,550
and I think that’s what I liked most about the game.

84
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:05,483
Gothic is very grounded game, that you feel like is tough,

85
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,833
it's hard, but it’s also very realistic.

86
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:12,416
What was amazing to me the first time that I played Gothic was

87
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,783
how you could solve a lot of situations, taking advantage of everyone.

88
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,466
Everyone would take advantage of you of course, but then you have

89
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:24,216
these chances where you can take advantage of a

90
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,250
character killing a scavenger for you so you can go around something.

91
00:05:28,383 --> 00:05:29,383
I think what I like the most

92
00:05:29,383 --> 00:05:33,766
about Gothic is that it combines magic and everything.

93
00:05:34,016 --> 00:05:37,700
Even though it’s a fantasy game, it’s very believable.

94
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:43,216
It’s not 100% realistic, but we do try to make it look realistic.

95
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:46,333
It combines these two worlds

96
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,616
and it doesn’t give you the feeling that you’re

97
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:50,883
in a game that couldn’t exist in real life,

98
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,483
but rather something that makes you

99
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:57,650
feel like you’re inside the character and that you could be living that.

100
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,950
The living world - like the simulation that like,

101
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:04,400
everything has a daily routine, you can affect it.

102
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:07,466
You can get to discover, kind of like be part of the life.

103
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:11,600
It was the first simulation that I feel like was not centered
around the player.

104
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:17,983
It was actually going on while, you know,
you were not a center of attention for everything.

105
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,083
You were just a nobody.

106
00:06:19,316 --> 00:06:21,933
I really like was the progression system

107
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,800
and how you learn abilities and what also the progression
have an impact on

108
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:31,350
your fighting styles your main character had.

109
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:36,483
Really, I think everybody struggle fighting against the first scavanger

110
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:39,483
or run away from the diggers.

111
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,883
And for me this point from then,

112
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:46,533
learning that all the decisions make sense
and all that affect and in the end of the game

113
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:49,550
you are stronger and you get "a name" in the colony

114
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,016
for me, that's the most memorable thing of the of the game.

115
00:06:52,016 --> 00:06:55,016
For me them the main thing that for me defines Gothic,

116
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:56,683
it's the way you interact with other characters.

117
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:59,966
I mean, it's not about, you know, killing 20 wolves,

118
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:04,233
and so you get rise in your level of expertise in sword fighting.

119
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:11,266
It's about find someone, convince him to teach you, how to improve your skills and then

120
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:15,583
maybe if you are good enough, he will teach you something.

121
00:07:15,983 --> 00:07:17,500
This human relations.

122
00:07:17,783 --> 00:07:23,783
Our aim was also, to create this Remake, in a mindfull way

123
00:07:23,783 --> 00:07:25,883
and with respecting greatly the original,

124
00:07:26,216 --> 00:07:30,400
but we also wanted to setup with the graphics, to be like

125
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,016
a modern game with the realistic look. Right?

126
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:37,200
And that kinda fights with the original, because the original,

127
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:40,750
they only had so much polygons for figures for example,

128
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:47,200
and with these restrictions, you design creatures and NPCs and whatever.

129
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,900
You design it in a very specific way to get the fantasy in your head.

130
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,916
You had to do this, but back in the day.

131
00:07:55,316 --> 00:07:57,000
If there is people who are like,

132
00:07:57,233 --> 00:07:58,233
"Yeah, but I like this look!"

133
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:01,616
If you really like the look of the original game,

134
00:08:01,766 --> 00:08:04,533
I mean, I think that there is the game for you, which is the original.

135
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:10,800
And thankfully, I mean, you can now play Gothic 1 and 2 as classic editions

136
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,183
on modern consoles.

137
00:08:13,183 --> 00:08:15,133
Which I think was also

138
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,050
one of our strategies is always to

139
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,783
to take care about franchises and IP’s to make sure,

140
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,283
that thing that people love is actually preserved.

141
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:30,183
In the end we're fighting to recreate beloved memories,

142
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:34,716
And in Spanish we say, there is a say:
“Cualquier tiempo pasado fue mejor”

143
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:39,900
it seems “Any time, any past time was way better”

144
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,483
So in the end, we're trying to challenge
with these, but it's a nice challenge.

145
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:47,416
So when I see, when I read some fans comments about

146
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,600
and they see for example New Camp, image we released

147
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,000
not much time ago and they say,

148
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,650
“Wow, this is exactly how the New Camp was in my mind, when I was playing.

149
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:04,183
And then some other fans show him the real image of the New Camp of the original game and they say

150
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,783
“What the hell? What is this?”

151
00:09:07,366 --> 00:09:09,566
In my head it was like the remake one.

152
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:12,966
So first of all, I think that the fan base of the original

153
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,750
is a multilayered,

154
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:17,883
demographic and structure.

155
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:22,300
I think that not one voice that you can listen to and say

156
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,183
if you do it like that, everybody will like it.

157
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,966
And that's, that's the core problem.

158
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,183
There's so many different opinions.

159
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,800
There is even like, when we did the the Gothic Playable Teaser,

160
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,200
there were even like old fans who were like,

161
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:38,466
“Great finally they are doing something different with it!”

162
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,550
I disagree with this.

163
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:43,400
I feel like with the the Playable Teaser the aim was to really push

164
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,983
the boundaries and go over it to get strong reactions, and we got that.

165
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:48,233
So so that worked out.

166
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,583
So back in the day we were asking what fans want, what do they want?

167
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:56,066
They want to, I mean, the same story with new graphics?

168
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,700
Or maybe a retold? Maybe the one with new story within the world?

169
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,700
Or maybe they want something

170
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,050
in the line of new modern games where the character is always talking

171
00:10:05,716 --> 00:10:08,450
you know, doing jokes to the player, I don't know.

172
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:10,833
So we thought, okay, let's go stream.

173
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,933
Let's force a very strong reaction.

174
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:16,466
And with that we can understand what they really want.

175
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,150
And in the end we got the reaction.

176
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:22,466
We got a lot of ideas from the fans, the fans showed us the way

177
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:26,033
and they help us to create the the
pillars, the pillars of a Gothic Remake.

178
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:30,500
I remember four years ago creating a document with the pillars

179
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,850
of the game review and saying, okay, those are the we can not move.

180
00:10:35,383 --> 00:10:38,733
Those are the pillars of everything what we are we constructing
the next years.

181
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:41,016
Those are the funding pillars and it should be there.

182
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:45,966
So for me the PT was good because, it helped
us to define those basic pillars.

183
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:46,966
And we are here today.

184
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:51,400
When we started to create the real Gothic 1 Remake and got the green light to do it,

185
00:10:52,183 --> 00:10:55,350
we set out to, or we defined that.

186
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:00,200
First and foremost, we have to please the old Gothic fans.

187
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:02,966
Because if they don't like our game,

188
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,300
then this game has no right to exist.

189
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:10,116
I will say two things.
The first thing is to the fans, is that I hope that they fully understand

190
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:14,516
the way we embrace the original, the way we respect and try,

191
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:18,783
we are trying to honor the original, because we understand how important is this game.

192
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Well, the franchise, but Gothic 1 is special for them.

193
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:25,800
Sometimes I read fans telling, “Okay, I was playing this with my father

194
00:11:26,566 --> 00:11:28,783
and i will play the Remake with my son”

195
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:34,483
So I hope that they understand that we are doing this
with passion and with all of our heart.

196
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:39,450
It's the people out there that make us do what we love doing.

197
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,116
It's they enable us to do that and

198
00:11:42,116 --> 00:11:46,666
they are kind of the other half of that,

199
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:50,500
that world that kind of only works if the both halves come together.

200
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,100
We being passionate game developers
that pour our hearts and souls

201
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,833
into making the game and the audience
that enjoys playing those games

202
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,550
and kind of keeping it to life over so many years.

203
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:08,466
And for the future, I would like to play a Remake
in 20 years with Arán, with my son.

204
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:12,100
He is 2 years old now, but maybe in
15 years or 16 years we can play together.

205
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,883
And he says, “Okay Papa, you did this?” and I say "Yes".

206
00:12:14,883 --> 00:12:18,916
But yeah, but maybe in ten years we can we can play together.

207
00:12:42,864 --> 00:12:44,493
The Nameless Hero - the Nameless Hero

208
00:12:44,493 --> 00:12:46,244
23 meat bugs were harmed during the creation of this video

209
00:12:46,244 --> 00:12:47,934
2 meat bug stews were consumed during the making of this episode

210
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:49,645
The Sleeper is still sleeping

211
00:12:49,645 --> 00:12:52,253
Everything will be fine.
