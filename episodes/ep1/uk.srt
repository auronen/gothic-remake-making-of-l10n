00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,400
Оригінальна Ґотика

3
00:00:10,633 --> 00:00:14,566
була настільки популярною та унікальною в той час, що я відчуваю, що

4
00:00:14,566 --> 00:00:17,466
вона заслуговує на належний римейк.

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Створення ремейку Gothic 1

6
00:00:40:00 - 00:00:43:00
Розділ I - Ґотичний дух

6
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,000
Наш підхід полягав передусім у тому, щоб

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:54,550
поважати та сприймати оригінальне бачення гри.

8
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:58,950
Ми вивчали оригінальне бачення, намагалися зрозуміти все,

9
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:01,116
що намагалися сказати, та намагалися донести.

10
00:01:01,116 --> 00:01:04,666
І ми просто подумали: «добре, це ж Ремейк».

11
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,066
Це перше, що повинні розуміти фанати,

12
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,450
ми не намагаємося винайти велосипед або зробити щось божевільне

13
00:01:10,616 --> 00:01:11,933
з франшизи Ґотики.

14
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:13,733
Це римейк - ми приймаємо,

15
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:17,466
шануємо оригінальне бачення, і просто намагаємося підходити до цього 

16
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:19,416
з великою повагою.

17
00:01:19,483 --> 00:01:22,916
Через стільки років, а насправді через досить короткий проміжок часу,

18
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:26,300
після виходу Ґотики 1, коли я повертаюся до музики

19
00:01:26,316 --> 00:01:27,316
що я писав тоді,

20
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,783
Завжди знаходжу речі, які хотілося б покращити.

21
00:01:32,183 --> 00:01:35,016
Якби було більше часу, я б викинув деякі речі 

22
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,983
та замінив їх іншими задумами,

23
00:01:37,616 --> 00:01:40,500
це постійно, знаєте,

24
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:43,483
прагнути та намагатися зробити все якнайкраще.

25
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,600
Тепер з'явився другий шанс, і я можу повернутися до своєї музики

26
00:01:46,716 --> 00:01:49,616
яку я написав тоді, і створювати нові версії,

27
00:01:49,733 --> 00:01:52,466
створювати свіжі версії, які витримують випробування часом.

28
00:01:52,833 --> 00:01:56,083
Минуло понад 20 років з моменту виходу першої ґотики,

29
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,200
і складно думати про те, як

30
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,500
переносити щось, що має таку історію,

31
00:02:02,866 --> 00:02:06,183
до сучасності, з тією якістю життя, яку ми маємо зараз

32
00:02:06,183 --> 00:02:10,566
та як залишатися вірними оригіналу

33
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,166
досвід гри у такій грі,

34
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,150
що була досить інноваційною, зовсім новою

35
00:02:16,433 --> 00:02:20,733
для всього ринку і те, що внесла в рольові ігри.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,633
Я занурився у світ Ґотики

37
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:27,200
завдяки Каю Розенкранцу та його творам.

38
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:34,133
And I want to say a big thank you to Snowball localization team,

39
00:02:34,283 --> 00:02:36,316
because they made a huge job.

40
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:41,050
The voices and localization, it helped me a lot to go deeper in this world.

41
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:45,566
I think that Gothic 1 was a game that allows

42
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:48,600
the player to go everywhere, anywhere and anytime.

43
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,916
So that feeling that the player has,

44
00:02:52,183 --> 00:02:54,600
to make his own choices.

45
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,016
There was I don't know, 15 years?

46
00:02:57,216 --> 00:02:59,400
Over 10 years. There was nothing happening with it.

47
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:03,316
Which is sad because it's like, it's a franchise and the game

48
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,500
the people deeply care about and are very emotional towards to,

49
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,983
and I'm I myself sad actually

50
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:14,016
that I never got to play another Gothic game in this time.

51
00:03:14,466 --> 00:03:17,316
We are - fighting with memories.

52
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:20,733
We’re just trying to embrace the original vision of the authors.

53
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,150
When I was young, I've played the games in German.

54
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,400
It was one of the only games

55
00:03:25,883 --> 00:03:31,200
which had a real character and authenticity

56
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:34,000
to German like culture.

57
00:03:34,216 --> 00:03:37,100
The dialogues were written in a way how

58
00:03:37,216 --> 00:03:42,916
you and me would speak, if we would be, I don’t know, frankly drinking a beer and talking about stuff. Right?

59
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:46,666
And that is something that, was never done by a game,

60
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,766
like it was so natural and so close to reality

61
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:56,183
in a way, like without being a simulation or whatever.

62
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,966
Kind of fascinated me always. Right?

63
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,450
because it also like, they were cursing each other in the game

64
00:04:02,683 --> 00:04:06,666
and reacting to each other in a very rude way sometimes,

65
00:04:07,016 --> 00:04:10,250
and that was kind of attractive for me.

66
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:14,766
I think this game has something special from the start,

67
00:04:14,766 --> 00:04:18,583
right from the moment you begin playing, it grabs you,

68
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:21,300
it draws you in with that,

69
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:22,800
with that dark

70
00:04:23,033 --> 00:04:25,450
and tough aura that is established very quickly.

71
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:31,533
That feeling of being part of the world

72
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:35,183
is already there in the music, the environments, in everything.

73
00:04:36,983 --> 00:04:40,266
I really liked Gothic, because of the setting and the world.

74
00:04:41,033 --> 00:04:43,400
What really caught my attention was that it was a game

75
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,033
I wasn’t used to playing at the time.

76
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:48,950
A game that doesn’t guide you, doesn’t tell you where to go

77
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:49,950
or what to do.

78
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,616
You have to pay attention to what the characters say,

79
00:04:52,616 --> 00:04:54,433
buy the map, and stay very alert.

80
00:04:54,433 --> 00:04:55,433
That’s truly

81
00:04:55,433 --> 00:04:57,166
a very immersive experience,

82
00:04:57,466 --> 00:05:01,550
and I think that’s what I liked most about the game.

83
00:05:01,816 --> 00:05:05,483
Gothic is very grounded game, that you feel like is tough,

84
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,833
it's hard, but it’s also very realistic.

85
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:12,416
What was amazing to me the first time that I played Gothic was

86
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,783
how you could solve a lot of situations, taking advantage of everyone.

87
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,466
Everyone would take advantage of you of course, but then you have

88
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:24,216
these chances where you can take advantage of a

89
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:28,250
character killing a scavenger for you so you can go around something.

90
00:05:28,383 --> 00:05:29,383
I think what I like the most

91
00:05:29,383 --> 00:05:33,766
about Gothic is that it combines magic and everything.

92
00:05:34,016 --> 00:05:37,700
Even though it’s a fantasy game, it’s very believable.

93
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:43,216
It’s not 100% realistic, but we do try to make it look realistic.

94
00:05:43,866 --> 00:05:46,333
It combines these two worlds

95
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:48,616
and it doesn’t give you the feeling that you’re

96
00:05:49,033 --> 00:05:50,883
in a game that couldn’t exist in real life,

97
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,483
but rather something that makes you

98
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:57,650
feel like you’re inside the character and that you could be living that.

99
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,950
The living world - like the simulation that like,

100
00:06:00,266 --> 00:06:04,400
everything has a daily routine, you can affect it.

101
00:06:04,616 --> 00:06:07,466
You can get to discover, kind of like be part of the life.

102
00:06:07,683 --> 00:06:11,600
It was the first simulation that I feel like was not centered
around the player.

103
00:06:11,966 --> 00:06:17,983
It was actually going on while, you know,
you were not a center of attention for everything.

104
00:06:18,083 --> 00:06:19,083
You were just a nobody.

105
00:06:19,316 --> 00:06:21,933
I really like was the progression system

106
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:26,800
and how you learn abilities and what also the progression 
have an impact on

107
00:06:28,033 --> 00:06:31,350
your fighting styles your main character had.

108
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:36,483
Really, I think everybody struggle fighting against the first scavanger

109
00:06:36,483 --> 00:06:39,483
or run away from the diggers.

110
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:41,883
And for me this point from then,

111
00:06:42,066 --> 00:06:46,533
learning that all the decisions make sense
and all that affect and in the end of the game

112
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:49,550
you are stronger and you get "a name" in the colony

113
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:52,016
for me, that's the most memorable thing of the of the game.

114
00:06:52,016 --> 00:06:55,016
For me them the main thing that for me defines Gothic,

115
00:06:55,016 --> 00:06:56,683
it's the way you interact with other characters.

116
00:06:56,683 --> 00:06:59,966
I mean, it's not about, you know, killing 20 wolves,

117
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:04,233
and so you get rise in your level of expertise in sword fighting.

118
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:11,266
It's about find someone, convince him to teach you, how to improve your skills and then

119
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:15,583
maybe if you are good enough, he will teach you something.

120
00:07:15,983 --> 00:07:17,500
This human relations.

121
00:07:17,783 --> 00:07:23,783
Our aim was also, to create this Remake, in a mindfull way

122
00:07:23,783 --> 00:07:25,883
and with respecting greatly the original,

123
00:07:26,216 --> 00:07:30,400
but we also wanted to setup with the graphics, to be like

124
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,016
a modern game with the realistic look. Right?

125
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:37,200
And that kinda fights with the original, because the original,

126
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:40,750
they only had so much polygons for figures for example,

127
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:47,200
and with these restrictions, you design creatures and NPCs and whatever.

128
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:52,900
You design it in a very specific way to get the fantasy in your head.

129
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,916
You had to do this, but back in the day. 

130
00:07:55,316 --> 00:07:57,000
If there is people who are like,

131
00:07:57,233 --> 00:07:58,233
"Yeah, but I like this look!"

132
00:07:58,566 --> 00:08:01,616
If you really like the look of the original game,

133
00:08:01,766 --> 00:08:04,533
I mean, I think that there is the game for you, which is the original.

134
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:10,800
And thankfully, I mean, you can now play Gothic 1 and 2 as classic editions

135
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,183
on modern consoles.

136
00:08:13,183 --> 00:08:15,133
Which I think was also

137
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,050
one of our strategies is always to

138
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,783
to take care about franchises and IP’s to make sure,

139
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,283
that thing that people love is actually preserved.

140
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:30,183
In the end we're fighting to recreate beloved memories,

141
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:34,716
And in Spanish we say, there is a say:
“Cualquier tiempo pasado fue mejor”

142
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:39,900
it seems “Any time, any past time was way better”

143
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,483
So in the end, we're trying to challenge
with these, but it's a nice challenge.

144
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:47,416
So when I see, when I read some fans comments about

145
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,600
and they see for example New Camp, image we released

146
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:53,000
not much time ago and they say,

147
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:57,650
“Wow, this is exactly how the New Camp was in my mind, when I was playing.

148
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:04,183
And then some other fans show him the real image of the New Camp of the original game and they say

149
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,783
“What the hell? What is this?”

150
00:09:07,366 --> 00:09:09,566
In my head it was like the remake one.

151
00:09:09,766 --> 00:09:12,966
So first of all, I think that the fan base of the original

152
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,750
is a multilayered,

153
00:09:14,933 --> 00:09:17,883
demographic and structure.

154
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:22,300
I think that not one voice that you can listen to and say

155
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,183
if you do it like that, everybody will like it.

156
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:25,966
And that's, that's the core problem.

157
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,183
There's so many different opinions.

158
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,800
There is even like, when we did the the Gothic Playable Teaser,

159
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:35,200
there were even like old fans who were like,

160
00:09:35,733 --> 00:09:38,466
“Great finally they are doing something different with it!”

161
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,550
I disagree with this.

162
00:09:39,716 --> 00:09:43,400
I feel like with the the Playable Teaser the aim was to really push

163
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,983
the boundaries and go over it to get strong reactions, and we got that.

164
00:09:47,066 --> 00:09:48,233
So so that worked out.

165
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:51,583
So back in the day we were asking what fans want, what do they want?

166
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:56,066
They want to, I mean, the same story with new graphics?

167
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,700
Or maybe a retold? Maybe the one with new story within the world?

168
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,700
Or maybe they want something

169
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:05,050
in the line of new modern games where the character is always talking

170
00:10:05,716 --> 00:10:08,450
you know, doing jokes to the player, I don't know.

171
00:10:08,783 --> 00:10:10,833
So we thought, okay, let's go stream.

172
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:12,933
Let's force a very strong reaction.

173
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:16,466
And with that we can understand what they really want.

174
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,150
And in the end we got the reaction.

175
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:22,466
We got a lot of ideas from the fans, the fans showed us the way

176
00:10:22,466 --> 00:10:26,033
and they help us to create the the
pillars, the pillars of a Gothic Remake.

177
00:10:26,033 --> 00:10:30,500
I remember four years ago creating a document with the pillars

178
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,850
of the game review and saying, okay, those are the we can not move.

179
00:10:35,383 --> 00:10:38,733
Those are the pillars of everything what we are we constructing 
the next years.

180
00:10:38,733 --> 00:10:41,016
Those are the funding pillars and it should be there.

181
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:45,966
So for me the PT was good because, it helped
us to define those basic pillars.

182
00:10:45,966 --> 00:10:46,966
And we are here today.

183
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:51,400
When we started to create the real Gothic 1 Remake and got the green light to do it,

184
00:10:52,183 --> 00:10:55,350
we set out to, or we defined that.

185
00:10:55,350 --> 00:11:00,200
First and foremost, we have to please the old Gothic fans.

186
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:02,966
Because if they don't like our game,

187
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,300
then this game has no right to exist.

188
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:10,116
I will say two things.
The first thing is to the fans, is that I hope that they fully understand

189
00:11:10,266 --> 00:11:14,516
the way we embrace the original, the way we respect and try,

190
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:18,783
we are trying to honor the original, because we understand how important is this game.

191
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Well, the franchise, but Gothic 1 is special for them.

192
00:11:22,233 --> 00:11:25,800
Sometimes I read fans telling, “Okay, I was playing this with my father

193
00:11:26,566 --> 00:11:28,783
and i will play the Remake with my son”

194
00:11:29,566 --> 00:11:34,483
So I hope that they understand that we are doing this
with passion and with all of our heart.

195
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:39,450
It's the people out there that make us do what we love doing.

196
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,116
It's they enable us to do that and

197
00:11:42,116 --> 00:11:46,666
they are kind of the other half of that,

198
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:50,500
that world that kind of only works if the both halves come together.

199
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,100
We being passionate game developers
that pour our hearts and souls

200
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,833
into making the game and the audience
that enjoys playing those games

201
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:02,550
and kind of keeping it to life over so many years.

202
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:08,466
And for the future, I would like to play a Remake
in 20 years with Arán, with my son.

203
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:12,100
He is 2 years old now, but maybe in
15 years or 16 years we can play together.

204
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,883
And he says, “Okay Papa, you did this?” and I say "Yes".

205
00:12:14,883 --> 00:12:18,916
But yeah, but maybe in ten years we can we can play together.

206
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
The Nameless Hero - the Nameless Hero

207
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,000
23 meat bugs were harmed during the creation of this video

208
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,000
2 meat bug stews were consumed during the making of this episode

209
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
The Sleeper is still sleeping

210
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,000
Everything will be fine.
